A Log Query analyzer for PostgreSQL
-------------------------------------
Point the command line tool to a single PostgreSQL csv log file or a log 
directory to import the contents and run analytics on the queries.

Note
----
Not documented and poorly tested - hence it is broken, so don't use as of
now
